# Artworking project base

This is a starting point for all frontend builds at [Artworking](http://artworking.uk/).

## Downloading

For now, just grab a copy of the [latest version (zip)](https://github.com/artworking/base/archive/master.zip) – in the future, we’ll be creating [releases](https://github.com/artworking/base/releases) instead.

2. Clone a copy of this repository, fix and test thoroughly.
