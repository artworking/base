# UI styles

The `ui/` directory should contain concrete styles for setting out the major UI components of the website or application. A UI component is usually defined as a collection of smaller objects.

- Header
- Footer
- Sidebar
- Blog post
- Products list

Itâ€™s important that the `ui/` components are loaded _after_ the `objects/` directory.
