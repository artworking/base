# Generic

The `generic/` directory contains rulesets which are likely to apply across multiple websites.

Please do not change any code in this directory unless it is to fix a bug or add a new feature to our project base â€“ in which case, follow the instructions in `/README.md` to replicate it in our GitHub repository for use in future builds.
